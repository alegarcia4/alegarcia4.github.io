### CPSC 120

* Hi-Lo Game (Lab 4, Part-2)
    This lab was one of my favorites because I learned how to use If statements and If-else statements. I also mastered taking in user input. I also liked the game itself and it reminds me of games I have seen before.

* Blackjack Game (Lab 6, Part-2)
    I liked this lab because I enjoy playing blackjack. I learned how to play blackjack with my dad. This lab was also fun to code and learn along the way.

* Parking Functions (Lab 7, Part-2) 
    I liked this lab because it was one of the most challenging labs we had. We had to look at images of whether you could park on a street or not and we coded it into the program. It was fun to learn along the way to this lab and it helped me to understand the topics.
